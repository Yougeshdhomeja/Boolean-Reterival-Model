# Boolean-Reterival-Model
Developed Boolean Retrieval Model in order to retrieve relevant documents according to Query given by user.
The objective of this Model is to make you understand how different indexes work in
retrieving different query from a collection. You will create Inverted index and Positional index
for a set of collection to facilitate Boolean Model of IR. Inverted files and Positional files are the
primary data structure to support the efficient determination of which documents contain specified
terms and at which proximity. You also learn to process simple Boolean expression queries
through this Model.
